#### Course Description
- Computer systems architectureÍ¾ logic, data representation, assembly language, mem
 ory organization and trends.


#### Course Objectives 
- This course is to delve into structure and implementation of computer architecture. Though the lectures and the textbook will continue to get more acquainted with the MIPS architecture and how it relates to decoding and implementing high level languages such as C++ and JAVA.


#### By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Represent numbers in various bases, convert numbers from one basis to another, and perform arithmetic operations on the numbers
- Apply floating point standard representations to convert floating point numbers from decimal to binary and vice versa
- Apply the knowledge of computer performance to compute response time of a computer on a given program
- Write MIPS assembly code for a given problem description
- Write assembly code equivalence of a high level problem given for example in C
- Assess performance of two computers on a given program workload
- Identify how computers execute instructions and how register and memory contents are modified as a result of this execution
- Simplify a given boolean function, draw its equivalent gatelevel circuit, and compare the simplified circuit with the original one in terms of delay and area complexity
- Identify values of various control signals in a computer as a program is being executed by CPU
- Identify what hardware blocks are active during execution of various instructions
- Apply the knowledge of pipelining to compute the amount of time that it takes to execute a program on a pipelined architecture
- Assess performance of a pipelined architecture versus an architecture without pipelining
- Understand and apply strategies to deal with hazards in an architecture with pipelining
- Compare performance of a computer with cache memory versus one without cache memory
- Apply the knowledge of sequential circuits to identify how output of a sequential circuit changes during each clock cycle
- Identify content of a cache memory for various cache designs including direct mapped, set associative, and fully associative designs
- Apply the knowledge of memory hierarchy to compute hit rate, miss rate, and miss penalty for various memory hierarchy designs
