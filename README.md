# CPTS302 - [Group Case Study (GCS) Assignment](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS302-ProfessionalSkillsInComputing-Engineering/blob/Initial-Final-Report/gcs_assign.pdf)

## Overview
For this assignment, you will work in teams of five or six students. Your teamâ€™s task is to research a case study topic, prepare an ethical analysis, and write a report. The final report must utilize the ethical theories, models, and/or SECEPP code covered in class. The assignment will develop your ability to analyze complex ethical issues and communicate your findings effectively.

## Learning Objectives
1. **Awareness of Issues**: Increase awareness of issues and dilemmas surrounding professional topics (ABET Outcome 4a).
2. **Ethical Analysis and Recommendations**: Report an ethical analysis and recommendations for resolving the case using ethical theories and critical reasoning (ABET Outcomes 4a, 4c, 4d, 4e, 4f).
3. **Effective Communication**: Write a well-organized, well-focused report using visual aids effectively (ABET Outcomes 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e).
4. **Information Literacy**: Identify, locate, evaluate, use responsibly, and share information for the problem at hand (ABET Outcomes 7a, 7c, 7d, 7e, 7f).

## Project Steps
1. **Project Management**: Hold an initial group meeting to agree on a project management plan, allocate tasks, and establish due dates. Implement your plan using Asana.
2. **Research**: Read the case description and conduct thorough research. Use credible sources, such as bona fide news articles, refereed publications, and textbooks. A minimum of five credible references is required.
3. **Ethical Analysis**: Identify ethical issues in the case and analyze them using at least two different ethical theories or models. Consider using structured arguments to support your analysis.
4. **Recommendations**: Develop a set of recommendations for resolving the case. Provide a well-reasoned resolution that considers ethical theories, logic, and stakeholder impacts.
5. **Writing the Report**: Use the IEEE Conference template for your report. Your report should include:
   - Title and List of Authors
   - Abstract (100-150 words)
   - Keywords (3-5 keywords)
   - Introduction (1/2 to 1 column)
   - Case Summary (at least 1 column)
   - Ethical Analysis (2-4 columns)
   - Recommendations (2-4 columns)
   - Conclusions (1/3 to 1/2 column)
   - References (minimum of five credible references)

## Grading
- **Initial Report**: Ensures all elements are in place and provides course correction for the final report. Grading focuses on form.
- **Final Report**: Graded on substance, meeting specifications, grammar, reasoning strength, and coherence. Team member evaluations will adjust the baseline grade.

## Team Member Evaluations
- You will distribute (n-1) x 100 points among team members to evaluate their contributions.
- Points reflect the effort made by each member, with 100 points indicating equal contribution.
- The average score will be used to calculate a weight for the final report grade, capped at a multiplier of 1.25.
